# Crunchyroll-VPN-Refresher
[Firefox add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/crunchyroll-vpn-refresher/)  

_(Probably doesn't support Crunchyroll Beta)_

Crunchyroll doesn't immediately show region blocked content after switching to another country through a VPN. In order to 
show the content available in the connected VPN country, this add-on adds a button that removes a cookie and then refreshes the page.

The button can be found at the top right of the page, next to the "Queue" item.

**Usage**
1. Connect to a specific country through your VPN.
2. Click the Refresh button.
3. Crunchyroll will now show episodes available in that country.
